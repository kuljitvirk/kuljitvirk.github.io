I am interested in theoretical condensed matter physics and optics. This website is to maintain a set of notes and links to codes that I create in my own time to continue my study of these fields. In the past 3 years, I have devoted most of my time to learning the theory behind quantum computing by working out problems in the book by Nielsen and Chuang. I've written my own account of this understanding in <a href="src/QuantumComputing01.pdf">"Technical Notes on Quantum Computing"</a>. Through these, I learned to derive the key techniques to represent an algorithm through quantum circuit, as well as the algorithms: Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Phase Estimation, Period finidng, Shor's Algorithm, Trotter-Suzuki technique and its variants. I followed this by learning about quantum error correction, driven at first by an interest to understand how the degeneracy of ground states is exploited in toric codes. This inspired me to learn and understand the basics with stabilizers and quantum error correcting codes, and after working through problem sets, I started preparing a second set of notes on <a href="src/QuantumComputing02.pdf">Stabilizers and Error Correcting Codes</a>. These are still in progress. 

In my academic research, I gained expertise in modeling and studying open quantum systems. My papers published on this topic are available on the web. I always found it useful to have the key steps of Lindblad master equation formalism nearby. Here are my notes on deriving master equations to second order in perturbation theory.<br>

<h2> Optics </h2>
In my present job, I work in optics and often employ machine learning algorithms for detection. Though I cannot share any of the technically specific work, I have extracted some of the theory into a set of notes that can be used to learn a few specific topics. These are listed below.
  
<a href="src/Fresnel.pdf">Fresnel reflection at an interface between uniaxial media.</a>
<br>
<a href="src/SpinGlassTechniques.pdf">Techniques in the analysis of random networks and spin glasses.</a>
<br>
<a href="src/VariationalGMM.pdf">Variational Gaussian Mixtures Model.</a>
This is essentially a summary of the various chapters in the book "Pattern Recognition" by Christopher Bishop.

<a href="src/mie_theory.pdf">Mie theory with near and far field solutions.</a>
